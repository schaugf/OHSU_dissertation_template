# OHSU Dissertation Template

Writing a dissertation takes time, and none of it should be wasted screwing around with document design.
In the spirit of making a dissertation easy to write, I created this minimalist example dissertation template based on my own document.
The specifics are formatted for OHSU's dissertation design requirements, but they are easily modified to suite your institution's draconian formatting requirements.

Happy type-setting!
